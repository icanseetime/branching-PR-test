## Contribute to the project

### Setup

1. Go to Github and find an issue that is assigned to you
2. Create a new **feature** branch in your local repository that follows the naming conventions explained in [this table](#branching)
    - ‚ö† Make sure that the new branch is branching out from the **develop** branch
3. Publish your branch
4. Move the issue on the Kanban board from _To do_ to _In progress_
5. Work on your issue until you are done and then move to the [pull request](#pull-requests) section

### Pull request

1. Finish commiting all the changes to your branch
    - Make sure you have tested that everything is working before the next step
2. Go to [the Github repo](https://github.com/icanseetime/branching-PR-test) and click the Pull request tab
3. Create a new pull request and make these changes to the setup:
    - Make sure the base branch is **develop**
    - Make sure the compare branch is the **feature** branch you have been working on
    - Check that there is a green check mark and the text "Able to merge"
        - If there are conflicts, you should figure out what the conflicts are, and how to solve them
    - Write a title for the pull request that explains what has been done
        - Optional step: Write a comment if you have something more to say about the work, that can not be summarized in the title
    - Add a reviewer
    - Create the pull request
4. Wait for the reviewer to review your request
5. When the reviewer:
    - approves your PR: continue with step 6
    - requests changes: make the suggested changes, commit them to the branch, update the pull request and request a re-review
6. Merge the pull request
7. Delete branch
8. Move the issue on the Kanban board from _In progress_ to _Done_

## Branching

| Type            | Information                                                                                              | Name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **master/main** | What the users see / production branch. This branch automatically deploys when something is merged.      | Always named **_master_** or **_main_**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| release         | 1 branch per new release of the site. Used to test the new release before merging into master to deploy. | Named using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), e.g.: **_v1.0.0_**                                                                                                                                                                |
| **develop**     | Where the current work happens.                                                                          | Always named **_develop_**                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **feature**     | 1 branch per new feature. (1 issue = 1 feature)                                                          | Should be named **_feature/{ID}-{name}_**, where the _ID_ is the ID of the related issue, and the _name_ is the name of the issue you are working on. E.g.: _feature/1524-shopping-cart_. Issue name can be shortened if it is very long. |
| bugfix          | 1 branch per bug fix. Used when fixing errors (issues with bug tag)                                      | Should be named **_bugfix/{name}_**, where the _name_ is the name of the issue you are working on. E.g.: _bugfix/spelling-errors-in-menu_.                                                                                                |

‚ö† _This is a fairly common branching system, but you should always check what system is being used for each project you are working on._
